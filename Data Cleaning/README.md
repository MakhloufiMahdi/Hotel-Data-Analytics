## Data Cleaning
The data cleaning part of the R script applies a complete process of preparing the hotel booking dataset. It starts with handling missing values: replacing NA in the children and babies columns with 0, removing rows without a specified country, and creating a "None" category for the company and agent columns. Then, the data types are corrected by converting dates, transforming categorical variables into factors, and indicators into booleans. Outliers are filtered . The script then enriches the dataset with new variables such as the total number of nights, the total number of guests, and the seasonality of arrivals. Finally, it removes duplicates, checks data quality one last time, and saves the cleaned dataset in Excel format.
