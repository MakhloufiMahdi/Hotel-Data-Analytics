## Detailed Analysis of the  Dashboard
# 📍 Page 1 – Hotel Booking Overview
KPIs at the top
Average Lead Time: 79.97 days
→ On average, guests book almost 80 days in advance. This is relatively long, suggesting that customers plan trips well ahead (likely leisure travelers rather than last-minute business).

Revenue: 9.76M
→ Total revenue captured in the dataset. Provides a benchmark to compare segment contributions.

Bookings: 87K
→ Total number of reservations processed. Helps link revenue with occupancy.

Bookings by Hotel Type

City Hotels: ~53K bookings (61%)

Resort Hotels: ~34K bookings (39%)

💡 Insight:
City hotels dominate in volume. This could be due to business travel, short stays, or easier accessibility. Resort hotels likely contribute fewer but higher-value stays (to be checked with ADR & revenue breakdown).

Bookings by Distribution Channel

TA/TO (Travel Agencies/Tour Operators): 70.68%

Direct: 21.76%

Corporate: 7.56%

💡 Insight:

The business relies heavily on intermediaries (70%+).

Direct bookings are relatively small but still meaningful.

Corporate share is minimal → suggests the market is leisure-driven, not business.

⚠️ Risk: Reliance on OTAs and TOs means higher commission costs and lower margins.

Revenue by Meal Type

BB (Bed & Breakfast): highest revenue contributor.

HB (Half Board): 2nd most popular.

SC (Self Catering) & FB (Full Board): very limited share.

💡 Insight:
Guests overwhelmingly prefer BB, showing a preference for flexibility (breakfast included, but meals taken outside). Resorts may push HB/FB, but data suggests limited uptake.

Bookings by Room Type

Type A rooms dominate (~69K bookings).

Type D & E are minor (~13K & 5K).

💡 Insight:

Type A likely represents standard rooms.

Other categories (premium/luxury) are underutilized. This may suggest limited upselling success.

Monthly Bookings Trend

Peak: August (~11.2K bookings).

Secondary peak: December (~10K).

Lowest: February (~4.7K).

💡 Insight:

Seasonality is very strong.

Bookings are driven by summer holidays (July–August) and festive/winter holidays (December).

# 📍 Page 2 – Performance Trends by Month
ADR (Average Daily Rate)

Peak ADR: July (~112), August (~104).

Lowest ADR: Jan–Feb (~34–35).

💡 Insight:

Pricing is highly seasonal.

Hotels maximize rates in high-demand summer and apply deep discounts in winter.

ADR drops sharply after September, showing weak demand in shoulder months.

Nights by Month

Peak: August (12.9K nights), July (12.1K nights).

Low: February (3.9K nights).

💡 Insight:

Guests stay longer in summer.

Shorter stays dominate in low season → likely weekend trips or short breaks.

Lead Time by Month

Highest in August (~0.9M cumulative days).

Lowest in February (~0.17M).

💡 Insight:

Guests book much earlier for summer stays.

Low season bookings are last-minute (shorter lead times).

Monthly Revenue

Peak: August (~2.0M), December (~1.7M).

Lowest: February (~0.3M).

💡 Insight:

Revenue peaks align with ADR + nights (summer & December holidays).

February combines low ADR, few nights, and short stays → the weakest month financially.

February is consistently the weakest month → opportunity for off-season campaigns.

# 🌍 Page 3 – Geographical Analysis of Bookings

Data points are spread across all continents, but the highest density is in Europe.

Key Observations

Europe Dominates

The largest bubbles are concentrated in Western & Central Europe.

Suggests that the majority of guests come from European countries.

Likely due to proximity, affordability of travel, and cultural tourism patterns.

Secondary Markets

Noticeable bubbles in North America (USA, Canada).

South America also shows demand (Brazil, Argentina).

Asia-Pacific has medium-sized bubbles (China, India, Australia).

Long-tail Distribution

Many small bubbles across Africa, Southeast Asia, and island nations.

Indicates a global reach, but with much smaller demand from those markets.

Insights & Interpretation

Core customer base is European.
This aligns with the earlier insights (seasonality around European holiday patterns).

North America and Asia are important but secondary contributors.
These regions bring international guests, likely with higher ADR and longer stays, since they travel farther.

Opportunity to grow long-haul markets.
While smaller in volume, international travelers may be more profitable → targeting campaigns in the US, China, and Australia could yield higher-value bookings.

Diversification of source markets could reduce reliance on European seasonality.
## 📌 Overall Business Insights

# Strong seasonality:

July–August = highest occupancy, longest stays, highest ADR.

December = strong revenue despite fewer nights (higher festive rates).

February = weakest month in all KPIs.

# Channel dependency:

Heavy reliance on OTAs/TOs (70%).

Direct bookings are underdeveloped.

Corporate share is tiny → business travel is not a focus.

# Hotel Type performance:

City hotels dominate volume (61%), but ADR & length of stay may be higher for resorts.

Need a profitability comparison (Revenue per Available Room – RevPAR).

Room Type preference:

Type A dominates (~80% of bookings) → likely standard rooms.

Upselling to higher categories is weak.

# Meal Plans:

BB is the most popular.

Very low share of HB/FB → upselling opportunity (esp. in resorts).
