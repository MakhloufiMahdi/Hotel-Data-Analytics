# In the Machine Learning part, hotel booking data is used to predict whether a reservation will be canceled or not.
After preprocessing (data cleaning, creation of new variables, normalization of numerical columns, and encoding of categorical variables), three models are trained: logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost. Their performance is evaluated using AUC and ROC curves: logistic regression achieves an AUC of 0.84, random forest 0.89, while XGBoost reaches 0.92, making it the best-performing model. The analysis of feature importance in XGBoost shows that factors such as the number of parking spaces, the online booking channel, or the customerâ€™s country of origin play a key role in predicting cancellations. These results enable the hotel to better anticipate booking behaviors.
