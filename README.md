# Hotel-Data-Analytics

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data through a complete data pipeline, from raw data inspection to machine learning predictions.  
The workflow covers data preparation, database creation, ETL processes, SQL analysis, dashboard visualization, and machine learning modeling.  

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- **DATA/**
  - Contains the raw hotel booking dataset.  
  - Includes **`Source Data Inspection.pdf`**, which provides a structured overview and description of each field in the dataset.

- **Data Cleaning/**
  - R scripts used for cleaning and preparing the dataset for further processing.

- **Oracle/**
  - the database and tables in Oracle.  
  - Contains SQL analysis queries for insights extraction.

- **TALEND/**
  - Contains evidence of the ETL process (Data Mapping and Processing) implemented using Talend.

- **POWER BI/**
  - Contains evidence of the dashboard creation and its analytical insights.

- **Machine Learning/**
  - Python scripts for applying machine learning techniques to the cleaned and processed data.

## ðŸ”‘ Workflow

1. **Data Inspection**  
   - Understanding and documenting dataset fields (`Source Data Inspection.pdf`).

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Cleaning and preprocessing with R.

3. **Database Creation**  
   - Designing and creating Oracle database tables.

4. **ETL (Data Mapping & Processing)**  
   - Using Talend to transform and load data into the database.

5. **SQL Analysis**  
   - Running SQL queries to extract insights from Oracle DB.

6. **POWER BI Visualization**  
   - Building interactive dashboards to highlight findings.

7. **Machine Learning**  
   - Applying predictive modeling with Python to analyze booking patterns and trends.
