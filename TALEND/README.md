## Data Mapping and Processing

In this step, I mapped the data from the input CSV file into the Oracle tables.  
The PDF illustrates the connection to the CSV file, the integration with the Oracle tables, as well as the creation of jobs and a few examples of jobs.  
Finally, I added a simple expression that converts the variable `arrival_date_month` into its corresponding month number.
